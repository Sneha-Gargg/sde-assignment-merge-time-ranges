# 🛠️ Merge Time Ranges – SDE Assignment (Saralweb)

This project solves the problem of merging overlapping or closely spaced time ranges using a given threshold.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

You are given an array of time ranges (`[start, end]`) where:
- Time is given in **UNIX timestamps (milliseconds)**
- Ranges may **overlap or touch**
- Small gaps between ranges (≤ threshold) should also be **merged**
- Return sorted and non-overlapping merged ranges
